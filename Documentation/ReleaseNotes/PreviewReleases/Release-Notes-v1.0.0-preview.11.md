<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Bug Fixes üêõ</h2>

1. [#95](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/CICD/issues/95) - Fixed a bug where the **_Hot Fix PR Status Check_** target was checking if the preview feature issue number existed.
   - A hotfix uses a hot-fix branch, not a preview feature branch, which is why this was a bug.
