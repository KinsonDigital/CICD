<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Bug Fixes üêõ</h2>

1. [#33](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/CICD/issues/33) - Fixed bug where the `SecretService` was incorrectly building the path to the local secrets file resulting in not finding the file and failing running targets.
   - This was only occurring on local runs.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Breaking Changes üß®</h2>

1. [#33](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/CICD/issues/33) - Renamed the build parameter `BuildSettingsDirPath` to `WorkFlowTemplateOutput`. The CLI switch equivalent is `workflow-template-output`.
   - This build parameter functions the same and is still used to determine the directory output path for generating workflows.  The name of the parameter was not renamed in previous releases when it was repurposed.
