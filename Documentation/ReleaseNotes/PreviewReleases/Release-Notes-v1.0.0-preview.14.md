<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">New Features ✨</h2>

1. [#121](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/CICD/issues/121) - Added a new feature where a project README can have pre-processing performed on it during a release.
   - This pre-processing entails using special markers that can be put into the README file.  These markers allow automation for commenting and uncommented content within the file.  The main purpose of this is due to different systems such as nuget.org not supporting the same markdown syntax as GitHub.
