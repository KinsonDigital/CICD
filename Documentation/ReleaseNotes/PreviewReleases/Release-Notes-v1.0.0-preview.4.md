<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">New Features ‚ú®</h2>

1. [#19](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/CICD/issues/19) - Created the list of services below to help abstract the way local vs server builds.
   - `CurrentDirService` - Gets the current directory of where the application is executing.  This increases testability.
   - `ExecutionContextService` - Determines if the build is running locally or on the server.  This increases testability.
   - `GitHubClientService` - Creates a GitHubClient singleton with authorized requests.  This makes it much easier to be able to deal with the `GitHubClient` locally and on the server.

   - `SecretService` - Loads secrets locally or on the server depending on where the build is running.
